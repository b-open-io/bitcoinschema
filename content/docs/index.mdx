# Bitcoin Schema

> Data definitions for Bitcoin applications

Bitcoin Schema enables limitless interoperability and collaborative networks by providing standardized data structures for Bitcoin applications.

## What is Schema?

Bitcoin Schema is a community-driven initiative that provides extensible schemas enabling developers to create interoperable data-based applications on Bitcoin SV. Standing on the shoulders of giants, our idea was inspired by the [Schema.org](https://schema.org) project.

## Key Features

- **Unlock Limitless Interoperability** - Standardized data structures allow applications to seamlessly share and understand each other's data
- **Build Collaborative Networks** - Enable rich social interactions, content sharing, and collaborative features across applications
- **Community Driven** - Schemas are developed and maintained by the Bitcoin developer community
- **Extensible** - New schemas can be added as common use cases are identified and implemented
