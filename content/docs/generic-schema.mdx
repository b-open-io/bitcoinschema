# Generic Schemas

These are generic schemas that can be used for many use cases.

## Payment

Payment is used to describe a payment sent from one identity to another. It is used by [BPP](https://github.com/icellan/bpp) when creating Content Paywalls.

### OP_RETURN Format

```
MAP SET app <appname> type payment context tx tx <txId>
```

### Optional Parameters

- Context
- ContextValue
- Subcontext
- Subcontext Value

### Use Cases

- Content paywalls
- Subscription payments
- Tip payments
- Service payments

## Future Schemas

More schemas will be added as common use cases are identified and implemented in the wild. Some potential future generic schemas include:

- **Image** - For image metadata and references
- **Handle** - For user handle registration and management
- **Profile** - For user profile information
