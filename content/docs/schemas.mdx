# All Schemas

This page contains a comprehensive list of all available Bitcoin Schema definitions.

## Available Schemas

- [Generic Schemas](/docs/generic-schema) - General-purpose schemas that can be used for many use cases
- [Social Schemas](/docs/social-schema) - Communication and social networking schemas

## Contributing New Schemas

More schemas will be added as common use cases are identified and implemented in the wild. If you have a use case that would benefit from a standardized schema, please:

1. [Open an issue](https://github.com/bitcoinschema/schema/issues/new) to discuss your use case
2. Submit a pull request with your proposed schema
3. Join our [Slack community](https://atlantistic.slack.com/app_redirect?channel=schema) to discuss with other developers

## Schema Format

All Bitcoin Schema definitions follow a consistent format using the MAP (Magic Attribute Protocol) and AIP (Author Identity Protocol) standards:

- **MAP** prefix: `1PuQa7K62MiKCtssSLKy1kh56WWU7MtUR5`
- **AIP** prefix: `15PciHG22SNLQJXMoSUaWVi7WSqc7hCfva`

Each schema includes:
- **Purpose** - What the schema is used for
- **OP_RETURN format** - The exact transaction structure
- **Optional parameters** - Additional fields that can be included
- **Code examples** - Implementation examples in various languages
