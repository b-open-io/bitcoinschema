General-purpose schemas that can be used across many different types of applications.

## Payment

Payment is used to describe a payment sent from one identity to another. It is commonly used by [BPP](https://github.com/icellan/bpp) when creating Content Paywalls and subscription services.

### OP_RETURN Format

```
MAP SET app <appname> type payment context tx tx <txId>
```

### Optional Parameters

- **Context**: The context of the payment (e.g., "subscription", "content", "tip")
- **ContextValue**: The value associated with the context
- **Subcontext**: Additional context layer (e.g., "plan_type", "content_id")
- **Subcontext Value**: Value for the subcontext

### Use Cases

**Content Paywalls**
- Track payments for premium content access
- Link payments to specific articles, videos, or downloads
- Support tiered access levels

**Subscription Payments**
- Monthly/yearly subscription tracking
- Plan upgrades and downgrades
- Trial period management

**Tip Payments**
- Social media tipping
- Content creator support
- Micro-donations

**Service Payments**
- API usage fees
- Processing service costs
- Platform fees

### Implementation Examples

**Basic Payment:**
```
MAP SET app myapp type payment context tx tx abc123...
```

**Subscription Payment:**
```
MAP SET app myapp type payment context subscription subcontext plan_type subcontextValue premium context tx tx abc123...
```

**Content Purchase:**
```
MAP SET app myapp type payment context content subcontext article_id subcontextValue art_456 context tx tx abc123...
```

## Future Schemas

Additional generic schemas are planned based on community needs:

### Image
For image metadata and references, including:
- Image dimensions and format
- Alt text and descriptions
- Location and timestamp data
- Copyright and licensing info

### Handle
For user handle registration and management:
- Unique username claiming
- Handle transfers and updates
- Cross-platform handle verification

### Profile
For comprehensive user profile information:
- Display names and bio
- Avatar and banner images
- Social links and contact info
- Verification badges

## Contributing New Generic Schemas

If you have ideas for new generic schemas:

1. [Open an issue](https://github.com/b-open-io/bitcoinschema/issues/new) to discuss your proposal
2. Join our [Discord community](https://discord.gg/vqj6wpKeEn) for discussions
3. Submit a pull request with your schema definition

Consider these questions when proposing new schemas:
- Is this use case common across multiple applications?
- Does it provide clear value over existing schemas?
- Is the format flexible enough for different implementations?
- Are there existing standards we should follow?
